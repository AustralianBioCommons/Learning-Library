The Train the Trainer collection is curated and endorsed by Australian BioCommons and is designed to support individuals interested in upskilling as trainers. The collection consists of training materials and documentation from reputable sources and covers topics like effective teaching methods, curriculum development, and learner engagement.

As you explore the resources in this collection, you may wonder which training is best suited for your needs. Below, I share my insights on how each resource can be particularly useful, depending on goals as a trainer. These notes will help you navigate the options and make informed choices.

#### Lessons from The Carpentries: building confidence through live interaction

The Carpentries Instructor Training provides a strong foundation for teaching programming skills, with a focus on live coding as the primary method of delivery. This technique involves instructors solving problems and writing code in real time, offering learners an authentic, transparent experience. It’s an approach that fosters engagement and builds confidence, as learners see mistakes and debugging as natural parts of the process.
One of the most valuable aspects of this training is its emphasis on creating inclusive learning environments. Techniques such as setting expectations, encouraging questions, and normalizing mistakes are essential for ensuring that all learners feel comfortable and supported. 
Additionally, the focus on practical teaching tools, such as formative assessments, concept maps, and learner personas, provides trainers with methods to tailor their instruction to different audiences.
These techniques are particularly useful in engaging participants with varying levels of experience. 

#### FutureLearn: designing for outcomes and sustainability

The FutureLearn Train the Trainer program offers a more design-oriented perspective, making it an excellent complement to resources focused on delivery. 
A standout feature of this course is its structured approach to training design, particularly the use of backward design. Starting with the learning outcomes and working backward to align activities and assessments ensures that sessions are focused and purposeful. This is especially valuable in the bioinformatics field, where time and resources are often limited.
Another highlight is the course’s exploration of teaching styles and barriers to learning. By encouraging trainers to reflect on their own approach and recognize challenges learners might face, the program fosters a deeper understanding of how to create effective and inclusive training environments. 
Discussions around group dynamics and facilitation techniques are also particularly relevant for workshops, where managing interaction and engagement can significantly impact learning outcomes.
For potential trainers who may not be interested in full certification but still want to improve their skills, key takeaways from this training include goal-setting, resource planning, and facilitation strategies. 


#### Teaching Tech Together: a practical toolbox

This is a compact yet rich resource that offers trainers practical guidance for teaching technical skills. What sets this book apart is its abundance of exercises and activities, making it an excellent starting point for anyone looking to build ad-hoc Train-the-Trainer programs or facilitate team-building sessions.
The exercises are designed to be immediately actionable, helping trainers introduce formative assessments, set clear learning objectives, and engage learners effectively. These activities are adaptable and can be tailored to suit different audiences.
Another strong aspect of the book is its attention to online teaching. With practical tips on maintaining attention and fostering interaction in virtual environments, it addresses challenges that many trainers face in today’s hybrid learning landscape.
While the book doesn’t delve into content design or evaluation in depth, its value lies in its practicality. It provides trainers with tools they can pick up and use without needing to commit to extensive pedagogical training. For those who may want to share their knowledge but lack formal teaching experience, this resource offers an accessible and flexible approach.

#### Conclusion: Designing a new TtT Program for the Bioinformatics Community

These three resources collectively offer a comprehensive toolkit for developing an effective TtT course. The Carpentries provides the delivery skills necessary to engage and support learners in real time, while FutureLearn emphasizes designing sessions with clear goals and sustainable outcomes. Both courses, however, require practice and preparation to fully master their approaches.
Meanwhile, Teaching Tech Together offers an abundance of practical exercises to reinforce these skills and engage trainers in hands-on learning. If I were designing a new course, I would incorporate some of the book’s exercises as hands-on components. These could serve as icebreakers, team-building activities, or even skill-building opportunities during workshops. Pairing these practical tools with more comprehensive content on design and facilitation would create a well-rounded program that caters to trainers of all experience levels.
A new TtT course could leverage these strengths to address the specific needs of researchers. For example, integrating live coding practice from The Carpentries with guided exercises from Teaching Tech Together would help trainers build confidence and technical fluency. The design principles and facilitation strategies from FutureLearn would help ensure that trainers know how to design and develop their content effectively, avoiding common pitfalls such as trying to include everything they know or struggling to choose the most relevant material. By focusing on clear learning objectives and achievable outcomes, trainers can create content that is purposeful, streamlined, and impactful.
