### What is the Library?

The Library is the home of themed collections of resources curated by Australian life science communities in collaboration with Australian BioCommons. 

Researchers turn to people and organisations they trust for recommendations on where to focus their time and effort when getting started on a new topic. Those who have someone ask are often provided with a small selection of resources that are known to be of high quality and relevance. Collections capture these recommendations and share them, making the process of finding appropriate resources more efficient and equitable for all.

These collections serve as a recommended starting point on a given topic. They are not intended to be an exhaustive list of all resources associated with a topic.

### Who manages the Library and the collections?
The Australian BioCommons Training and Communications Team manages the Library and maintains editorial oversight of the content of collections.

BioCommons invites Australian researchers and service providers to create, and collaboratively maintain, collections of recommended, trusted resources in their areas of expertise. Where contributions are sourced from groups, an individual ‘owner’ will take responsibility for curating the collaborative input. If you or your community would like to curate a new collection, please contact the BioCommons training team at [training@biocommons.org.au](mailto:training@biocommons.org.au).

The different groups of people who have collaborated on each collection are listed on individual collection pages. All contributors are gratefully acknowledged on the [Contributors page.](https://australianbiocommons.github.io/Learning-Library/contributors)
