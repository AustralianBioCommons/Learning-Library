### Why a Library?
Finding resources that are appropriate is hard, especially when you are unfamiliar with a topic.

Researchers turn to people and organisations they trust for recommendations on where to focus their time and effort when learning about a new topic. Those who have someone ask are often provided with a small selection of resources that are known to be of high quality and relevance. The Library captures these recommendations and shares them, making the process of finding appropriate resources more efficient and equitable for all.

### What is the Library?

The Library is the home of themed collections of resources curated by Australian life science communities in collaboration with Australian BioCommons. 

These collections serve as a recommended starting point on a given topic. They are not intended to be a registry of all resources associated with a topic.

### Who curates the Library?
BioCommons invites Australian researchers and service providers to recommend trusted resources in their areas of expertise. If you or your community would like to curate a new collection for the Library, please contact the BioCommons training team at [training@biocommons.org.au](mailto:training@biocommons.org.au).

The different groups of people who have collaborated on each collection are listed on individual collection pages. All contributors are gratefully acknowledged on the [Contributors page.](https://australianbiocommons.github.io/Learning-Library/contributors)
