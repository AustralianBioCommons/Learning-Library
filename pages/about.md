The Learning Library houses collections of training materials that have been selected by the BioCommons team. This is not an exhaustive collection, rather it is a selection of training materials that we recommend. Training materials are sorted into collections - eg. training material related to proteomics can be found in the proteomics collection. Some materials may appear in more than one collection.
