### Why a Learning Library?
Finding learning resources that are appropriate is hard, especially when you are unfamiliar with the topic you want to learn.

Researchers turn to people and organisations they trust for recommendations on where to focus their time and effort when learning about a new topic. Those who have someone ask are often provided with a small selection of resources that are known to be of high quality and relevance. The Learning Library captures these recommendations for self-directed learning and shares them, making the process of finding training more efficient and equitable for all.

### What is the Learning Library?

The Learning Library is the home of themed collections of learning resources curated by Australian life science communities in collaboration with Australian BioCommons. 

These collections serve as a recommended starting point for learning about a given topic. They are not intended to be a registry of all materials associated with a topic.

Resources include videos, guides, online tutorials and recorded webinars that can be used for self-directed learning.

### Who curates the Learning Library?
BioCommons invites Australian researchers and service providers to recommend trusted resources in their areas of expertise. If you or your community would like to curate a new collection for the Library, please contact the BioCommons training team at [training@biocommons.org.au](mailto:training@biocommons.org.au).
