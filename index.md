## Browse the Library

The Learning Library houses collections of training materials that have been selected by the BioCommons team. This is not an exhaustive collection, rather it is a selection of training materials that we recommend.
Training materials are sorted into collections - eg. training material related to proteomics can be found in the proteomics collection. Some materials may appear in more than one collection.





## Collections

The following collections are available:

{% include section-navigation-tiles.html col = "3" type="Collection"%}

{% include section-navigation-tiles.html col = "1" type="all_resources"%}

{% include callout.html type="note" content="If you are seeking live training, please [visit the BioCommons website for upcoming events](https://www.biocommons.org.au/webinars-workshops)." %}
